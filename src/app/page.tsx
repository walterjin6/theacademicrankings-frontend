              The academic field is one of the most competitive arenas to be involved in, both locally and globally. By establishing an individual rank for an academic, you can position yourself as a top professor in the field, or as an individual who can move up the ranks overtime. This helps academics further develop their career and/or legitimately establish themselves as a leader in academia through a globally recognised system.

A legitimate rank of the members of academia can allow for further analysis on the performance of modern-day academics and their improvement over the years.

              Set yourself apart from your university ranking. Academics often find themselves stuck in a partnership with their university. This may sometimes be great, but your true talent may go unrecognised under the universities rank which lends itself to the academic output and students results rather than your own work. Your own personal rank acts as an identifier of your success and establishment, putting you on the forefront as an academic, and not just a university professor.
